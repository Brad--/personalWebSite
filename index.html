        <p>Hello my name is Garrett Phoonswadi and I am currently puersuing my second degree in computer science at Colorado State Univeristy. I recieved my frist degree in Ciological science from Colorado State Univeristy in 2013. After that I went into radiology research focusing on raditions affect on cancer cells. During my stretch in research I preformed many different expeiements and collected massive amounts of data. I started to get interested in computer science when trying to quantifiy the data I was collecting. This was a fun time in my college carrer I was even published in 2015 and traveled to Japan for a short amount of time to continue my research. After Japan I decided I needed to study Computer Science</p>

        <p>I Started studying computer science in 2014. In 2015 I got an internship at HP in the Stroage division. I worked for HP until 2016 when the company split into HPE and Helwert-Packard inc. I stayed on the same team working for HPE. I took a spring semester off in 2016 and worked full time for HPE. After that I returned to CSU to finish my degree. My future goals are to combine both of my degrees to push research to the next level</p>

      <h2>Ray Tracer</h2>
      <p>This ray tracer was build from scratch in c++ if you are interested in it I have it posted on github. It still needs a little fine tunning but it can draw some nice pictures.</p>

      <h2>Amino Acid Converter</h2>
      <p>This program takes in a squence of nucleotides and translates them to the amino acid sequence</p>
